# Create the Snake game using Canvas API 
by Harrison Fung 

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...) The goal of the unit is to use the Canvas API to make a snake game. AP CS Principles goes over   abstraction and functions for javascript. These will be useful for making a snake game with the Canvas API. At the school that I teach, the game could be an end of unit project, possibly one that is a stepping stone for the performance task needed for the AP Exam. The unit will go over the concepts of functions, variables, iterative processes and conditions needed to make the game of snake.

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

I thought that web development and JavaScript could go hand in hand for an end of unit project. API calls are not covered in CS Principles and this would be an end of semester project if anything. Since it is so unique, I thought that it would be nice to try and do something that is different than the curriculum but still borrows concepts that are learned during the semester. Students will learn to draw using the canvas api, however they do not need to make an API call seeing that the Canvas API is already uploaded into JavaScript in the browser.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

Abstraction and Decomposition
9-12.CT.4
Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

Clarifying Statement 
The focus is on having students think about how to decompose a programming problem into functions and procedures, including working around the constraints imposed by specific functions or features provided in a library.

Career Paths 
9-12.IC.7
Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

Clarifying Statement
At this level, the focus is on making connections between computer science and the fields of interest of individual students.

### Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Visual Studio Code, graphic organizers (Students with visual impairment issues)

### Lessons
Total length: 4 Weeks with a meeting time of at least 3 times per week. The lesson will depend on student knowledge prior to the lesson. Students will relearn about JavaScript functions, variables and interative statements and then be introduced to Canvas. The final week, students will start to code and to create the Snake Game. 

(list each lesson with main topic(s))

First week: 
Introduction to API's 

Second week: 
Going over JavaScript functions, variables, iterative statements

Third week: 
Coding in Canvas<br>

Fourth week:
Building the Snake game

### Assesments
(list summative and/or formative assessments used)

Formative Assessments: 
Pre-assessment for week 2 on JavaScript. 
The pre-assessment for week 2 will be a review type exam for students. They will be able to consult each other and to help each other get the answers to the questions. The point is to refresh students memories of JavaScript. 

Formative Assessment after week 2 on JavaScript. 
The JavasScript unit will be the most important unit for students to score well on the formative assessment. The formative assessment will not be co-operative and will be graded as well. Students will write an exam type assessment with multiple choice questions on JavaScript fundamentals. 

Week 2 will be a large part of the unit. It is the section that is not introducing new material yet and will test student knowledge of the class up until that point. It is expected to be rigorous but seeing that students can co-operate with each other at the beginning, it might make them less nervous. 

Summative Assessment: 
Creation of Snake Game 
The Snake Game will be created with some scaffolding for those students who need it. Students are to work alone on this section of the unit.
