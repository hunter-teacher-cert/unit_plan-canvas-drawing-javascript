# Drawings using JavaScript Canvas API
by Harrison Fung 

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
This would fit into a web development class. At the school that I am currently at, we teach CS Principles with Python. I am hoping to include this lesson in a similar class, but one where they use JavaScript. There are 4 sections of CS Principles at AFSE.

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

I thought that web development and JavaScript could go hand in hand for an end of unit project. API calls are not covered in CS Principles and this would be an end of semester project if anything. Since it is so unique, I thought that it would be nice to try and do something that is different than the curriculum but still borrows concepts that are learned during the semester. Students will learn to draw using the canvas api, however they do not need to make an API call seeing that the Canvas API is already uploaded into JavaScript in the browser.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

Abstraction and Decomposition
9-12.CT.4
Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

Clarifying Statement 
The focus is on having students think about how to decompose a programming problem into functions and procedures, including working around the constraints imposed by specific functions or features provided in a library.

Career Paths 
9-12.IC.7
Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

Clarifying Statement
At this level, the focus is on making connections between computer science and the fields of interest of individual students.
